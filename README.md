# IP address tracker solution

in this project I will be creating a IP address tracker landing page, integrating with the [ipify API](https://geo.ipify.org/) to fetch IP address information. The challenge is to build out this landing page, integrate with the [ipify API](https://geo.ipify.org/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - JS library
- [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - JS library
- api [ipify API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - API

### Useful resources
